<h2>Team Profile</h2>
<p>The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to reflect on how well the group has worked later.

Condense the relevant content you produced from Assignment 1. </p>



<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
<p>Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback from Assignment 1. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?
It can be tackled in numerous ways in writing in visual elements. A concise coverage/analysis/conclusion covering all would be good. Strongly recommend a table presentation of comparison data. As it is very easy to highlight a lot of information, and simple for others to read and interpret too. </p>
